# Customer Web (React Prototype)

This is a working React-based customer tracker for the demo server.

## Run
```
python3 -m http.server 8010 --directory apps/customer-web-react
```

Open `http://localhost:8010` and set:
- Server URL: `http://localhost:8081`
- Order ID: copy from the dispatch demo dropdown

## Notes
- Requires the core demo server on port 8081.
- This is a prototype and will evolve with the API service.
