agents/CLAUDE.md Rebuild Notes
Date: 2026-01-30
Author: Claude

REASON FOR REBUILD:
Original file was a stub with placeholder content that didn't match the actual project.

ISSUES WITH ORIGINAL:
1. Described "ride services" but RideNDine is a home kitchen food delivery platform
2. Referenced non-existent files (mcp_config.yaml, logging.yaml)
3. Placeholder agents (Agent 1, 2, 3) with no actual content
4. Generic MCP setup instructions not applicable to this project
5. No connection to actual codebase or documentation

NEW STRUCTURE:
1. Project Overview - Accurate description of RideNDine
2. Implementation Status - Links to AGENTS.md status table
3. Key Documentation - Index of all planning docs with descriptions
4. Project Conventions - Edit protocol, standards
5. Development Phases - Summary from DEVELOPMENTPLAN.md
6. Architecture Overview - Current vs target state
7. Quick Reference - Essential commands and ports

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCS:
- AGENTS.md: Agent roles, skills, detailed file mappings
- CLAUDE.md: Project context, conventions, doc index
- README.md: User-facing quick start and troubleshooting
- DEVELOPMENTPLAN.md: Full 16-week implementation roadmap
