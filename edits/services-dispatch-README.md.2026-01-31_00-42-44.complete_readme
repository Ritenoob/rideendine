# Dispatch Service

**Status:** Prototype (standalone service)

## Purpose
Assign drivers to orders using distance and reliability scoring.

## Run (dev)
```
node services/dispatch/server.js
```

## Endpoints
- `GET /health`
- `POST /assign` — accepts `{ orders, drivers, cooks, driverScores }`

## Notes
- Not yet wired to the core demo or API service.
- Intended to become a separate, scalable service.
