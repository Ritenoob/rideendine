## 🔧 Technical Debt & Gaps

### Backend Gaps
1. **Image Upload Endpoint Missing**
   - Need: `POST /upload` with Multer
   - Required for: Chef menu images, profile photos, delivery proof

2. **Push Notification Registration Missing**
   - Need: `POST /devices` to register FCM tokens
   - Required for: All push notifications

3. **Real-time Events Not Wired**
   - RealtimeService exists but not integrated into OrdersService
   - Lines 17 commented out in orders.service.ts
   - Need: Uncomment and add emit calls in state transitions

### Frontend Gaps
1. **No Root Navigation**
   - App.js is old demo code
   - Need: Complete App.tsx with NavigationContainer

2. **API Integration Incomplete**
   - Screens have UI but don't call API
   - Need: useEffect hooks to fetch data

3. **No Error Handling**
   - API calls lack try/catch
   - Need: Error boundaries and retry logic

4. **No Loading States**
   - Screens don't show spinners
   - Need: Loading indicators during API calls
